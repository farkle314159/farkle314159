- 👋 Hi, I’m @farkle314159
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux Mint; Python; MySQL; Photo editing using RawTherapee & digiKam; 
- Recording and editing music using Audacity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reading data using Python; integrating that with MySQL then visualizing with Orange 3
- 🌱 I’m also learning Photo editing using open source tools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above.  Check out the music score publishing repository!
- 📫 How to reach me: hmmm.  How to do this without getting sucked into yet ANOTHER spam bot?
